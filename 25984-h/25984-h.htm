PREFACE
</i>
</h3>
<p>
The Big Drum is published exactly as it was written, and as it was originally performed. At its first representation, however, the audience was reported to have been saddened by its &#34;unhappy ending.&#34; Pressure was forthwith put upon me to reconcile Philip and Ottoline at the finish, and at the third performance of the play the curtain fell upon the picture, violently and crudely brought about, of Ottoline in Philip's arms.
</p>
<p>
I made the alteration against my principles and against my conscience, and yet not altogether unwillingly. For we live in depressing times; and perhaps in such times it is the first duty of a writer for the stage to make concessions to his audiences and, above everything, to try to afford them a complete, if brief, distraction from the gloom which awaits them outside the theatre.
</p>
<p>
My excuse for having at the start provided an &#34;unhappy&#34; ending is that I was blind enough not to regard the ultimate break between Philip and Ottoline as really unhappy for either party. On the contrary, I looked upon the separation of these two people as a fortunate occurrence for both; and I conceived it as a piece of ironic comedy which might not prove unentertaining that the falling away of Philip from his high resolves was checked by the woman he had once despised and who had at last grown to know and to despise herself.
</p>
<p>
But comedy of this order has a knack of cutting rather deeply, of ceasing, in some minds, to be comedy at all; and it may be said that this is what has happened in the present instance. Luckily it is equally true that certain matters are less painful, because less actual, in print than upon the stage. The &#34;wicked publisher,&#34; therefore, even when bombs are dropping round him, can afford to be more independent than the theatrical manager; and for this reason I have not hesitated to ask my friend Mr. Heinemann to publish
<span class="sc">
The Big Drum

in its original form.

THE FIRST ACT
</p>
<p>
<i>
The scene is a room, elegantly decorated, in a flat in South Audley Street. On the right, two windows give a view, through muslin curtains, of the opposite houses. In the wall facing the spectator are two doors, one on the right, the other on the left. The left-hand door opens into the room from a dimly-lighted corridor, the door on the right from the dining-room. Between the doors there is a handsome fireplace. No fire is burning and the grate is banked with flowers. When the dining-room door is opened, a sideboard and a side-table are seen in the further room, upon which are dishes of fruit, an array of ice-plates and finger-bowls, liqueurs in decanters, glasses, silver, etc.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
The pictures, the ornaments upon the mantelpiece, and the articles of furniture are few but choice. A high-backed settee stands on the right of the fireplace; near the settee is a fauteuil-stool; facing the settee is a Charles II arm-chair. On the left of the room there is a small table with a chair beside it; on the right, not far from the nearer window, are a writing-table and writing-chair. Pieces of bric-&#224;-brac lie upon the tables, where there are also some graceful statuettes in ivory and bronze. Another high-backed settee fills the space between the windows, and in each window there is an arm-chair of the same period as the one at the fireplace.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
The street is full of sunlight.
</i>
</p>

</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
A triumph, to have dragged you out! [<i>Looking at his watch.</i>] Luncheon isn't till a quarter-to-two. I asked you for half-past-one because I want to have a quiet little jaw with you beforehand.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Delightful.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Er&#8212;I'd better tell you at once, old chap, whom you'll meet here to-day.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Aha! Your tone presages a most distinguished guest. [<i>Seating himself in the chair by the small table.</i>] Is she a
<i>
grande-duchesse</i>, or is he a crowned head?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Smiling rather uneasily.</i>] Wait. I work up to my great effect by degrees. We shall only be six. Collingham Green&#8212;&#8212;

<p>
Now, Phil, don't be naughty.

<p>

</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
And does it remarkably neatly, in my opinion.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Pouah! [<i>Leaning back in his chair, his legs outstretched, and spouting.</i>] &#34;Mrs. Trevelyan Potter, wearing a gown of yellow charmeuse exquisitely draped with chiffon, gave a dance for her niece Miss Hermione Stubbs at the Ritz Hotel last night.&#34; That sort o' stuff!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.

<p>
[<i>Ruefully.</i>] You don't grow a bit more reasonable, Phil; not a bit.

<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
I beg pardon. Go ahead.
</p>
<p class="actor">

[<i>Sitting on the fauteuil-stool.</i>] Mrs. Godfrey Anslow and Mrs. Wally Quebec. Abuse

<p>
Bless their innocent hearts!

They'll

<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
I trust so.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Scowling.</i>] A couple of pushing, advertising women.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Really&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Ha, ha! Sorry. That's five, with you and me.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
That's five, as you justly observe. [<i>Clearing his throat.</i>] H'm! H'm!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
The sixth? I prepare myself for your great effect.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>With an effort.</i>] Er&#8212;Madame de Chaumi&#233; is in London, Phil.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Sitting upright.</i>] Madame de Chaumi&#233;! [<i>Disturbed.</i>] Is

</i>
coming?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Y-y-yes.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Rising.</i>] Confound you, Robbie&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Hastily.</i>] She has got rid of her house in Paris and rejoined her people. She's with them in Ennismore Gardens.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, I'm aware of it. One reads of Ottoline's movements in every rag one picks up. [<i>Walking over to the right.</i>] She's the biggest
<i>
chasseuse
</i>
of the crowd.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
I assure you she appears very much altered.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.

<p>
What, can the leopard change his spots!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>

</i>
account; but Ottoline herself&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Faugh! [<i>Returning to
</i>
<span class="sc">
Roope</span>.] Why the devil have you done this?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Feebly.</i>] I confess, in the hope of bringing about a reconciliation.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
You&#8212;you good-natured old meddler. [<i>Quickly.</i>] Does she expect to find me here?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
No.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Making for the door on the left.</i>] I'll bolt, then.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Rising and seizing him.</i>] You shall do nothing of the kind. [<i>Forcing him down upon the fauteuil-stool.</i>] You'll upset my luncheon-table! [<i>Tidying himself.</i>] You're most inconsiderate; you are positively. And you've disarranged my necktie.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>In a low voice.</i>] How is she looking, Robbie?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Brilliant. [<i>Putting his necktie in order.</i>] Is that straight? Brilliant.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Gazing into space.</i>] Ten years ago, old man!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Quite.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
It was at her father and mother's, in Paris, that I made
<i>
your
</i>
acquaintance. Recollect?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Perfectly; in the Avenue Montaigne. I had a flat in the Palais-Royal at the time.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Scornfully.</i>] You were one of the smart set. It was worth their while to get hold of
<i>
you</i>.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
My dear Phil, do be moderately fair.
<i>
You
</i>
weren't in the smart set.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
No; I was trying my hand at journalism in those days. Dreadful trade! I was Paris correspondent to the
<i>
Whitehall Gazette</i>. That's why
<i>
I
</i>
was favoured. [<i>Abruptly.</i>] Robbie&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Hey?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
You'll scarcely credit it. One evening, while I was at work, Ottoline turned up with her maid at my lodgings in the Rue Soufflot, sent the maid out of the room, and proposed that I should &#34;mention&#34; her family in my letters to the
<i>
Whitehall</i>.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Mention them?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Drag in allusions to 'em constantly&#8212;their entertainments and so forth; boom them, in fact.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Was that the cause of the&#8212;the final&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Nodding.</i>] Yes. The following week her engagement to de Chaumi&#233; was announced.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>After a slight pause.</i>] Well, in spite of all this, I'm convinced she was genuinely attached to you, Phil&#8212;as fond of you as you were of her.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Resting his head on his hands.</i>] Oh, shut up!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, here's an opportunity of testing it, dear excellent friend. She's been a widow twelve months; you need have no delicacy on that score.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.

[<i>Looking up.</i>] Why, do you suggest&#8212;&#8212;?

Certainly; and without delay. I hear there's a shoal of men after her, including Tim Barradell.
</p>
<p class="actor">

</p>
<p>
[<i>With a grim smile.</i>] &#34;Bacon&#34; Barradell?
</p>

</p>
<p>
[<i>Assentingly.</i>] They say Sir Timothy's in constant attendance.
</p>
<p class="actor">

</p>
<p>
And what chance, do you imagine, would a poor literary cove stand against a real live baronet&#8212;and the largest bacon-curer in Ireland?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Rubbing his chin.</i>] You never know. Women are romantic creatures. She
<i>
might
</i>
prefer the author of those absorbing works of fiction whose pages often wrap up Tim Barradell's rashers.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Rising.</i>] Ha, ha, ha! [<i>Giving himself a shake.</i>] Even so it can't be done, Robbie; though I'm grateful to you for your amiable little plot. [<i>Walking about.</i>] Heavens above, if Ottoline married me, she'd be puffing my wares on the sly before the honeymoon was half over!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
And a jolly good job too. [<i>Moving to the left, peevishly.</i>] The truth is, my dear Phil, you're a crank&#8212;an absolute crank&#8212;on the subject of the&#8212;ah&#8212;the natural desire of some people to keep themselves in the public eye. Mercy on us, if it comes to that,
<i>
I'm
</i>
an advertiser!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
If it comes to that, you miserable old sinner, you
<i>
are</i>.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
I admit it, frankly. I own it gratifies me exceedingly to see my little dinner-parties and tea-parties, here or at my club, chronicled in the press. And it gratifies my friends also. Many of them wouldn't honour me at all if my list of guests wasn't in the fashionable intelligence next morning.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Oh&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Yes, you may roar. I declare I shudder to think of the difference it 'ud make to me socially if I didn't advertise.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Robbie, I blush for you.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Tosh! It's an advertising age.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Stalking to the fireplace.</i>] It's a beastly vulgar age.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
It's the age I happen to live in, and I accommodate myself to it. [<i>Pacing the room as he warms to his theme.</i>] And if it's necessary for a private individual such as myself to advertise, as I maintain it is, how much more necessary is it for
<i>
you
</i>
to do so&#8212;a novelist, a poet, a would-be playwright, a man with something to sell! Dash it, they've got to advertise soap, and soap's essential! Why not literature, which
<i>
isn't</i>? And yet you won't find the name of Mr. Philip Mackworth in the papers from one year's end to another, except in a scrubby criticism now and again.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Calmly.</i>] Excuse me, there are the publisher's announcements.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Publishers' announcements! I'm not speaking of the
<i>
regular
</i>
advertising columns. What I want to see are paragraphs concerning you mixed up with the news of the day, information about you and your habits, interviews with you, letters from you on every conceivable topic&#8212;&#8212;

<p>
[<i>Joining

talent goes a long way; advertising

talent is irresistible. Feed the papers. The more you do for them, the more they'll do for you.
<i>
Quid pro quo.
</i>
To the advertiser shall advertisement be given. Newspaper men are the nicest chaps in the world. Feed them gratis with bright and amusin' &#34;copy,&#34; as you term it, and they'll love and protect you for ever.
</p>
<p class="actor">

</p>
<p class="actor">

<p>
[<i>Leaving him.</i>] Oh, I've no patience with you! [<i>Spluttering.</i>] Upon my word, your hatred of publicity is&#8212;is&#8212;is&#8212;is morbid. It's worse than morbid&#8212;it's Victorian. [<i>Sitting in the chair by the small table.</i>] There! I can't say anything severer.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Advancing.</i>] Yes, but wait a moment, Robbie. Who says I have a hatred of publicity?
<i>
I
</i>
haven't said anything so absurd. Don't I write for the public?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Exactly!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Standing near

<p>
[<i>Shrugging his shoulders.</i>] Ah&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">

</p>
<p>
And I humble myself before the men and women of my craft&#8212;and they are many&#8212;who succeed in winning it in that fashion, or who are content to remain obscure. But for the rest&#8212;the hustlers of the pen, the seekers after mere blatant applause, the pickers-up of cheap popularity&#8212;I've a profound contempt for them and their methods.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
You can't deny the ability of some of 'em.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Deny it! Of course I don't deny it. But no amount of ability, of genius if you will, absolves the follower of any art from the obligation of conducting himself as a modest gentleman&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Ah, there's where you're so hopelessly Victorian and out o' date!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Well, that's my creed; and, whether I've talent or not, I'd rather snuff out, when my time comes, neglected and a pauper than go back on it. [<i>Walking away and pacing the room.</i>] Oh, but I'm not discouraged, my dear Robbie&#8212;not a scrap! I'm not discouraged, though you do regard me as a dismal failure.
</p>
<p class="actor">

</p>
<p>
[<i>Deprecatingly.</i>] No, no!

[<i>Shrugging her shoulders plaintively.</i>] Whether I should have ended by obeying my better instincts, and accepting you, I can't say. I believe I should. I&#8212;I believe I should. At any rate, I had already begun to chafe under the consciousness that, while you loved me, you had no esteem for me.

[<i>Blowing her nose.</i>] What was Dad before he went out to Buenos Aires with his wife and children; only a junior partner in a small concern in the City!

</p>
<p>
My poor dear girl!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
It's a relief to me to open my heart to you, Philip. [<i>He leads her to the fauteuil-stool.</i>] Robbie won't interrupt us yet awhile, will he?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
We'll kick him out if he does. [<i>They sit, close together, upon the fauteuil-stool.</i>] Oh, but he won't! This is a deep-laid plot of the old chap's&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
Plot?
</p>
<p class="actor">

</p>
<p>
To invite us here to-day, you and me, to&#8212;to&#8212;&#8212;

</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Exactly.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Softly.</i>] Ha, ha! Dear old Robbie! [<i>He laughs with her.</i>] Dear, dear old Robbie! [<i>Her laughter dies out, leaving her with a serious, appealing face.</i>] Phil&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Eh?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
Your sneer&#8212;your sneer about me and the papers&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Sneer?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
I detected it. Almost the first thing you said to me when I arrived was that you'd been gathering news of me lately from the papers!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Gently.</i>] Forgive me.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
It's been none of my doing; I've finished with
<i>
le snobbisme
</i>
entirely. [<i>Pleadingly.</i>] You don't doubt me?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Patting her hand.</i>] No&#8212;no.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
Nowadays I detest coming across my name in print. But my people&#8212;[<i>with a little
</i>
moue] they will persist in&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Beating the big drum?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
Ha! [<i>Brushing her hair from her brow fretfully.</i>] Oh! Oh, Phil, it was blindness on my part to return to them&#8212;sheer blindness!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Blindness?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
They've been urging me to do it ever since my husband's death; so I had ample time to consider the step. But I didn't realize, till I'd settled down in Ennismore Gardens, how thoroughly I&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Finding she doesn't continue.</i>] How thoroughly&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
How thoroughly I've grown away from them&#8212;ceased to be one of them. [<i>Stamping her foot.</i>] Oh, I know I'm ungrateful; and that they're proud of me, and pet and spoil me; [<i>contracting her shoulder-blades</i>] but they make my flesh feel quite raw&#8212;mother, Dad, and my brother Bertram! Their intense satisfaction with themselves, and everything appertaining to them, irritates me to such a pitch that I'm often obliged to rush out of the room to stop myself from being rude. [<i>Impetuously.</i>] And then to have to watch Dad and mother still pushing, scheming, intriguing; always with the affectation of despising
<i>
r&#233;clame</i>, yet doing nothing&#8212;not the most simple act&#8212;without a careful eye to it! Years ago, as I've said, there was an intelligible motive for our paltry ambitions; but now, when they have
<i>
forc&#233; les portes
</i>
and can afford to be sincere and independent&#8212;&#8212;! [<i>Checking herself.</i>] But I oughtn't to speak of my folks like this, ought I, even to you whom I can trust! [<i>Penitently.</i>] It's awfully wrong of me. I&#8212;I beg your pardon.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>After a short silence.</i>] What do you intend to do, then, Otto, ultimately&#8212;re-establish yourself in Paris?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Drearily.</i>] Paris! Is Paris so full of cheerful memories for me, do you suppose, that I should cling to it!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Soothingly.</i>] Oh, come&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
I travelled about for some months after I became a widow, and when I saw Paris again&#8212;! [<i>Starting up as if to rid herself of disagreeable sensations.</i>] No, my one great desire is to escape from it all, Phil&#8212;[<i>moving to the chair on the left</i>] to escape&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Rising.</i>] Escape?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
To alter the whole current of my life, if it's possible, [<i>sinking into the chair</i>] and to breathe some fresh air! [<i>Fanning herself with her hand.</i>] Phew-w-w-w!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
H'm! [<i>Approaching her and looking down upon her.</i>] According to report, Ottoline, you'd have very little difficulty in&#8212;escaping.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Glancing up at him.</i>] Report?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Rumour has it that there are at least a dozen ardent admirers at your feet, each with a wedding-ring in his waistcoat-pocket.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Reproachfully, her eyes meeting his.</i>] Why, have you been listening to tittle-tattle as well as studying newspaper paragraphs! [<i>He bows, good-humouredly.</i>] My dear Philip, allowing for exaggeration, granting that my
<i>
soupirants
</i>
number
<i>
half</i>-a-dozen, which of them would enable me to fill my lungs with fresh air? Who

</i>
they, these enterprising men&#8212;&#8212;?

Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Leaving her abruptly and going to the mantelpiece.</i>] Oh, pray don't ask

</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Lightly but softly.</i>] Sir Timothy! Sir Timothy has only just succeeded in fighting his way into the world I'm sick and tired of! [<i>Shaking her head.</i>] Poor Sir Tim! [<i>Pityingly.</i>] Ha, ha, ha, ha!

<p class="actor">
Philip.

<p>
What sort&#8212;spiritual and material?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Resting her elbow upon the arm of her chair and her chin upon her hand, musingly.</i>] Oh, I believe any world would content me that's totally different from the world I've lived in so long; any world that isn't flat and stale and stifling; that isn't made up of shams, and petty aims and appetites; any world that&#8212;well, such a world as you used to picture, Phil, when you preached your gospel to a selfish, common girl under the chestnuts in the All&#233;e de Longchamp and the Champs-Elys&#233;es! [<i>Half laughing, half sighing.</i>] Ha, la, la, la!

THE SECOND ACT
</p>
<p>
<i>
The scene is a morning-room, richly furnished and decorated, in a house in Ennismore Gardens. The walls are of panelled wood for two-thirds of their height, the rest being covered with silk. In the wall at the back, between the centre and the left-hand corner, there is a handsome double-door opening upon another door, covered in thick cloth, which is supposed to give admittance to the library. On the right, in a piece of wall running obliquely towards the spectator from the back wall to the right-hand wall, is a companion double-door to that on the left, with the difference that the panels of the upper part of this door are glazed. A silk curtain obscures the glazed panels to the height of about seven feet from the floor, and above the curtain there is a view of a spacious hall. When the glazed door is opened, it is seen that the hall is appropriately furnished. A window is at the further end of it, letting in light from the street, and on the right of the window there is a lofty screen arranged in such a manner as to suggest that it conceals the front door of the house.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
The fireplace, where a bank of flowers hides the grate, is in the left-hand wall of the room. On the further side of the fireplace there is an armchair, and before the fireplace a settee. Behind the settee, also facing the fireplace, are a writing-table and chair; close to the further side of the writing-table is a smaller chair; and at the nearer end of the settee, but at some distance from it, stands a low-backed arm-chair which is turned in the direction of the door on the right.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
On the other side of the room, facing the spectator and following the line of the oblique wall, is a second settee. On the left of this settee is an arm-chair, on the right a round table and another chair. Books and periodicals are strewn upon the table. Against the wall at the back, between the doors, are an oblong table and a chair; and other articles of furniture and embellishment&#8212;cabinets of various kinds, jardini&#232;res, mirrors, lamps, etc., etc.&#8212;occupy spaces not provided for in this description.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Among other objects upon the oblong table are some framed photographs, conspicuously displayed, of members of the Royal Family, and a book-rack containing books of reference.

<p>

It is daylight.

[<span class="sc">Miss Tracer</span>,

a red-haired, sprightly young lady, is seated upon the settee on the right, turning the leaves of a picture-paper. A note-book, with a pencil stuck in it, lies by her side. There is a knock at the door on the left.

<p>
[<i>Smiling at him winningly and moving to the settee before the fireplace.</i>] You're a nice boy; I'm sure you wouldn't make mischief. [<i>Sinking on to the settee with a yawn.</i>] Oh! Oh, I'm so weary!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Westrip.
</p>
<p>
Weary? Before you've begun your morning's work!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.
</p>
<p>
<i>
Before
</i>
I've begun it! I had a parade downstairs in the servants' hall at a quarter-to-ten.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Westrip.
</p>
<p>
Parade?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.
</p>
<p>
We've two new women in the house who are perfect idiots. They
<i>
can't
</i>
remember to say &#34;yes, my lady&#34; and &#34;no, my lady&#34; and &#34;very good, my lady&#34; whenever Lady Filson speaks to them. One of them actually addressed her yesterday as &#34;ma'am.&#34; I wonder the roof didn't fall in.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Westrip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Meditatively.</i>] I've noticed that Sir Randle and Lady Filson have a great relish for being Sir'd and Lady'd.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.
</p>
<p>
Ha, ha! Rather! [<i>Over her shoulder.</i>]
<i>
You
</i>
take a friendly hint. If your predecessor had Sir Randle'd and Lady Filson'd them more frequently, you wouldn't be standing in his shoes at this moment.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Westrip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>In the middle of the room, his hands in his pockets.</i>] Why
<i>
was
</i>
Sir Randle knighted, do you know?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.
</p>
<p>
Built a large drill-hall for the Territorials near his country place at Bramsfold.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Westrip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Innocently.</i>] Oh, is he interested in the Territorials?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Partly raising herself.</i>] Interested in the Territorials! How simple you are! He cares as much for the Territorials as I care for snakes. [<i>Kneeling upon the settee and resting her arms on the back of it, talkatively.</i>] The drill-hall was
<i>
her
</i>
notion; she engineered the whole affair.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Westrip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Opening his eyes wider and wider.</i>] Lady Filson?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Nodding.</i>] Her maid's my informant. A few years ago he was growing frightfully down-in-the-mouth. He fancied he'd got stuck, as it were&#8212;that everybody was getting an honour but himself. So the blessed shanty was run up in a devil of a hurry&#8212;excuse my Greek; and as soon as it was dry, Mrs. Filson, as she then was, wrote to some big-wig or other&#8212;without her husband's knowledge, she explained&#8212;and called attention to the service he'd rendered to the cause of patriotism. Lambert saw the draft of the letter on her mistress's dressing-table. [<i>Shaking with laughter.</i>] Ho, ho, ho! And what d'ye think?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Westrip.
</p>
<p>
W-well?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.

<p>
The corrections were in

</p>
<p class="actor">

<p>
[<i>Shocked.</i>] In Sir Randle's&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Jumping up.</i>] Phiou! I'm fearfully indiscreet. [<i>Going to

<p>
[<i>Moving to the round table.</i>] Quite&#8212;quite.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.
</p>

[<i>Following him.</i>] Oh, they're not a bad sort, by any means, if you just humour them a bit. We all have our little weaknesses, haven't we? I've mine, I confess.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Westrip.

[<i>Fervently.</i>] By Jove, isn't she!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Miss Tracer.
</p>
<p>
But then,
<i>
my
</i>
theory is that she was changed at her birth.

She's

not a genuine Filson, I'll swear. [<i>Suddenly walking away from him.</i>] H'sh!

My dear father, I cannot&#8212;I cannot profess to regret my sister's decision. I mean to

Ottoline being a widow, there can be no bridesmaids; which deprives us of the happiness of paying a pretty compliment to the daughters of several families of distinction whom we have the privilege of numbering among our acquaintances.

must

be frank&#8212;we had hoped that, in the event of Ottoline remarrying, she would contract such a marriage as is commonly described as brilliant.

<p>
[<i>Dryly.</i>] Such a marriage as her marriage to Monsieur de Chaumi&#233;, for example.

<p class="actor">

<p>
[<i>Nodding.</i>] They are distinctly disagreeable.

a good deal to be said against it.

<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Well, Sir Randle, I&#8212;I'm prepared to take a sporting chance. It may be that I am misled by the sanguine temperament of the artist, who is apt to believe that his latest production will shake the earth to its foundation. I've gammoned myself before into such a belief, but&#8212;[<i>resolutely</i>] I'll stake everything on my next book! I give you my word that if it isn't a success&#8212;an indisputable popular success&#8212;I will join you both, in all sincerity, in urging Ottoline to break with me. Come! Does that mollify you?

<p>
[<i>Deliberately, but losing himself in his subject as he proceeds.</i>] It shows a vast crowd of men and women, sir, forcing themselves upon public attention without a shred of modesty, fighting to obtain it as if they are fighting for bread and meat. It shows how dignity and reserve have been cast aside as virtues that are antiquated and outworn, until half the world&#8212;the world that should be orderly, harmonious, beautiful&#8212;has become an arena for the exhibition of vulgar ostentation or almost superhuman egoism&#8212;a cockpit resounding with raucous voices bellowing one against the other!

<p>
It shows the bishop and the judge playing to the gallery, the politician adopting the methods of the cheap-jack, the duchess vying with the puffing draper; it shows how even true genius submits itself to conditions that are accepted and excused as &#34;modern,&#34; and is found elbowing and pushing in the hurly-burly. It shows how the ordinary decencies of life are sacrificed to the paragraphist, the interviewer, and the ghoul with the camera; how the home is stripped of its sanctity, blessed charity made a vehicle for display, the very grave-yard transformed into a parade ground; while the outsider looks on with a sinking of the vitals because the drumstick is beyond his reach and the bom-bom-bom is not for him! It shows&#8212;&#8212;! [<i>Checking himself and leaving the arm-chair with a short laugh.</i>] Oh, well, that's the setting of my story, Sir Randle! I won't inflict the details upon you.

THE THIRD ACT
</p>
<p>
<i>
The scene represents two rooms, connected by a pair of wide doors, in a set of residential chambers on the upper floor of a house in Gray's Inn. The further room is the dining-room, the nearer room a study. In the wall at the back of the dining-room are two windows; in the right-hand wall is a door leading to the kitchen; and in the left-hand wall a door opens from a vestibule, where, opposite this door, there is another door which gives on to the landing of the common stair.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
In the study, a door in the right-hand wall admits to a bedroom; in the wall facing the spectator is a door opening into the room from the vestibule; and beyond the door on the right, in a piece of wall cutting off the corner of the room, is the fireplace. A bright fire is burning.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
The rooms are wainscotted to the ceilings and have a decrepit, old-world air, and the odds and ends of furniture&#8212;all characteristic of the dwelling of a poor literary man of refined taste&#8212;are in keeping with the surroundings. In the dining-room there are half-a-dozen chairs of various patterns, a sideboard or two, a corner-cupboard, a &#34;grandfather&#34; clock, and a large round table. In the study, set out into the room at the same angle as the fireplace, is a writing-table. A chair stands at the writing-table, its back to the fire, and in the front of the table is a well-worn settee. On the left of the settee is a smaller table, on which are an assortment of pipes, a box of cigars and another of cigarettes, a tobacco-jar, an ash-tray, and a bowl of matches; and on the left of the table is a capacious arm-chair. There is an arm-chair on either side of the fireplace; and against the right-hand wall, on the nearer side of the bedroom door, is a cabinet.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
On the other side of the room, facing the bedroom door, there is a second settee, and behind the settee is an oblong table littered with books and magazines. At a little distance from this table stands an arm-chair, and against the wall at the back, on the left of the big doors, is a chair of a lighter sort. Also against the back wall, but on the left of the door opening from the vestibule, is a table with a telephone-instrument upon it, and running along the left-hand wall is a dwarf bookcase, unglazed, packed with books which look as if they would be none the worse for being dusted and put in order.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
In the vestibule, against the wall on the right, there is a small table on which are Philip's hats, caps, and gloves; and an overcoat and a man's cape are hanging on some pegs.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
It is late on a November afternoon. Curtains are drawn across the dining-room windows, and the room is lighted rather dimly by an electric lamp standing upon a sideboard. A warm glow proceeds from the nearer right-hand corner as from a fire. The study is lighted by a couple of standard lamps and a library-lamp on the writing-table, and the vestibule by a lamp suspended from the ceiling.
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
The big doors are open.

</p>

<p class="scene">
[<span class="sc">Philip</span>,

the cigarette-box.</i>] No, I won't smoke. [<i>Seating himself upon the settee on the right.</i>] When was it settled?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Lighting his cigarette.</i>] The day before yesterday. I got Titterton to write me a letter&#8212;Titterton, my publisher&#8212;certifying to the enormous sales of the book, and sent it on to Sir Randle Filson. Nothing like documentary evidence, Robbie. [<i>Leaning back in his chair with outstretched legs and exhaling a wreath of tobacco-smoke.</i>] Twenty-five thousand copies, my boy, up to date, and still going strong.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Wonderful.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Phew! The critics treated me generously enough, but it hung fire damnably at first. At one particularly hellish moment I could have sworn it wouldn't do more than my usual fifteen or eighteen hundred, and I cursed myself for having been such a besotted fool as to pin my faith to it. [<i>Sitting upright.</i>] And then, suddenly, a rush&#8212;a tremendous rush! Twenty-four thousand went off in less than six weeks. Almost uncanny, eh? [<i>Touching the tobacco-jar.</i>] Oh, lord, sometimes I think I've been putting opium into my pipe instead of this innocent baccy, and that I shall wake up to the necessity of counting my pence again and apologizing to John for being in arrear with his wages!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
And Titterton's letter brought the Filsons round?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Nodding.</i>] Brought 'em round; and I must say they've accomplished the change of attitude most graciously.

[<i>Oracularly.</i>] Graciously or grudgingly, they couldn't help themselves, dear excellent friend. As you had pledged yourself in effect to resign the lady if your book was a failure, it follows that they were bound to clasp you to their bosoms if it succeeded. I don't want to detract from the amiability of the Filsons for an instant&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Anyhow, their opposition is at an end, and all is rosy. [<i>Rising and pacing the room.</i>] Master Bertram is a trifle glum and stand-offish perhaps, but Sir Randle&#8212;! Ha, ha, ha! Sir Randle has taken Literature under his wing, Robbie, from Chaucer to Kipling, in the person of his prospective son-in-law. You'd imagine, to listen to him, that to establish ties of relationship with a literary man has been his chief aim in life.

<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Jerking his head in the direction of the dining-room.</i>] And this is to be a family gathering&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
The first in the altered circumstances. I proposed a feast at a smart restaurant, but Sir Randle preferred the atmosphere which has conduced, as he puts it, to the creation of so many of my brilliant compositions. [<i>Behind the smoking-table, dropping the end of his cigarette into the ash-tray&#8212;gaily.</i>] Robbie, I've had a magnificent suit of joy-rags made for the occasion!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Earnestly.</i>] Good! I rejoice to hear it, dear excellent friend, and I hope it portends a wholesale order to your tailor and your intention to show yourself in society again freely. [<i>With a laugh,
</i>
<span class="sc">
Philip
</span>
<i>
goes to the fireplace and stands looking into the fire.</i>] Begin leaving your cards at once. No more sulking in your tent! [<i>Rising and crossing to the other side of the room.</i>] You have
<i>
arrived</i>, my dear chap; I read your name in two papers in my cabin yesterday. [<i>Marching up and down.</i>] Your foot is on the ladder; you bid fair to become a celebrity, if you are not one already; and your approaching marriage sheds additional lustre on you. I envy you, Phil; I do, positively.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Facing
</i>
<span class="sc">
Roope</span>.] Oh, of course, I shall be seen about with Ottoline during our engagement. Afterwards&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Halting.</i>] Afterwards&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Everything will depend on my wife&#8212;[<i>relishing the word</i>] my
<i>
wife</i>. Ottoline has rather lost her taste for Society with a capital S, remember.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Testily.</i>] That was her mood last June, when she was hypped and discontented. With a husband she can be proud of, surely&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Coming forward.</i>] As a matter of fact, Robbie, I'm inclined to agree with you; I've been staring into my fire, or out of my windows here, a jolly sight too much. [<i>Expanding his chest.</i>] It'll be refreshing to me to rub shoulders with people again for a bit&#8212;[<i>smiling</i>] even to find myself the object of a little interest and curiosity.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Delighted.</i>] Dear excellent friend!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Ha, ha! You see, I'm not without my share of petty vanity. I'm consistent, though. Didn't I tell you in South Audley Street that I was as eager for fame as any man living, if only I could win it in my own way?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
You did.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Exultingly.</i>] Well, I
<i>
have
</i>
won it in my own way, haven't I! [<i>Hitting the palm of his hand with his fist.</i>] I've done what I determined to do, Robbie; what I knew I
<i>
should
</i>
do, sooner or later! I've
<i>
got there</i>&#8212;got there!&#8212;by simple, honest means! Isn't it glorious?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Cautiously.</i>] I admit&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Breaking in.</i>] Oh, I don't pretend that there haven't been moments in my years of stress and struggle when I've been tempted to join the gaudy, cackling fowl whose feathers I flatter myself I've plucked pretty thoroughly in my book! But I've resisted the devil by prayers and fasting; and, by George, sir, I wouldn't swap my modest victory for the vogue of the biggest boomster in England! [<i>Boisterously.</i>] Ha, ha, ha! Whoop! [<i>Seizing

</p>
<p class="actor">

I must. [<i>Taking up his overcoat.</i>] I merely ran along to shake hands with you, and I'm sorry I took the trouble. [<span class="sc">Philip

</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.

<p>
[<i>Suddenly.</i>] Robbie&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Struggling with an obstinate sleeve.</i>] Hey?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
It's just struck me. Where are
<i>
you
</i>
dining to-night?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
At the Garrick, with Hughie Champion. [<i>Picking up his hat and gloves.</i>] He's getting horribly deaf and tedious; but I had nothing better.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Bother Colonel Champion! I wish you could have dined with
<i>
me</i>.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>His hat on his head, drawing on his gloves.</i>] Dear excellent
<i>
friend</i>! I should be out of place.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Rubbish! Your presence would be peculiarly appropriate, my dear Robbie. Wasn't it you who brought Ottoline and me together, God bless yer! [<i>Observing that
</i>
<span class="sc">
Roope
</span>

is weakening.</i>] There's heaps of room for an extra chair. Everybody 'ud be delighted.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Meditatively.</i>] I could telephone to Hughie excusing myself. He didn't ask me till this afternoon. [<i>With an injured air.</i>] I resent a short notice.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>His eyes twinkling.</i>] Quite right. Mine's short too&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
That's different.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Entirely. You'll come?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
If you're certain the Filsons and Madame de Chaumi&#233;&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Certain. [<i>Following

</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Opening the door.</i>] Charming.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Won't you let John fetch you a taxi?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Shaking hands with

<span class="sc">
Philip</span>.] No, I'll walk into Holborn. [<i>In the doorway.</i>] Oh, by-the-by, I've a message for you, Phil.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
From whom?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Barradell, of all people in the world.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Surprised.</i>] Sir Timothy?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
He's home. I crossed with him yesterday, and we travelled in the same carriage from Dover.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
What's the message?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
He saw your book in my bag, and began talking about you. He said he hadn't met you for years, but that I was to give you his warm regards.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Indeed?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Astutely.</i>] My impression is that he's heard rumours concerning you and Madame de Chaumi&#233; while he's been away, and that he's anxious to show he has no ill-will. I suppose your calling so often in Ennismore Gardens has been remarked.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Extremely civil of him, if that's the case. [<i>Loftily.</i>] Decent sort of fellow, I recollect.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Going into the vestibule.</i>] Very; very.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Poor chap!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Opening the outer door.</i>] Eight o'clock, dear excellent friend.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>At his elbow.</i>] Sharp.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.

<p>
Ha, ha! I'm not going to stop a minute. [<i>Rapidly.</i>] I've been to tea with Kitty Millington; and as I was getting into my car, I suddenly thought&#8212;! [<i>He kisses her.</i>] I waited in there to avoid Robbie Roope.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Robbie came back yesterday. I hope I haven't done wrong; I've asked him to dine here to-night.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
Wrong! Dear old Robbie! But I didn't want him just now. [<i>Loosening her wrap and hunting for a pocket in it.</i>] I've brought you a little gift, Phil&#8212;<i>en souvenir de cette soir&#233;e</i>&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Reprovingly.</i>] Oh&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
I got it at Cartier's this afternoon. I meant to slip it into your serviette to-night quietly, but it's burning a hole in my pocket. [<i>She produces a small jewel-case and presents it to him.</i>] Will you wear that in your tie sometimes?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Opening the case and gazing at its contents.</i>] Phiou! [<i>She leaves him, walking away to the fireplace.</i>] What a gorgeous pearl! [<i>He follows her and they stand side by side, he holding the case at arm's-length admiringly, his other arm round her waist.</i>] You shouldn't, Otto. You're incorrigible.

<p>
[<i>Still gazing at the scarf-pin.</i>] To-morrow I'll buy the most beautiful silk scarf ever weaved.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
Phil, I've a feeling that it's from to-night, when I sit at your table&#8212;how sweet your flowers are; I couldn't help noticing them!&#8212;I've a feeling that it's from to-night that we really belong to each other.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Pressing her closer to him.</i>] Ah&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
[<i>With a shiver, closing her eyes.</i>] What has gone before has been hateful&#8212;hateful!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Looking down upon her fondly.</i>] Hateful?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
Until&#8212;until your book commenced to sell, at any rate. Suspense&#8212;a horrid sensation of uneasiness, mistrust&#8212;the fear that, through your foolish, hasty promise to mother and Dad, you might, after all, unite with them to cheat me out of my happiness! That's what it has been to
<i>
me</i>, Philip.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Rallying her, but a little guiltily.</i>] Ha, ha, ha! You goose! I knew exactly how events would shape, Otto; hadn't a doubt on the subject. [<i>Shutting the jewel-case with a snap and a flourish.</i>]
<i>
I
</i>
knew&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Releasing herself.</i>] Ah, yes, I dare say I've been dreadfully stupid. [<i>Shaking herself, as if to rid herself of unpleasant memories, and again leaving him.</i>] Well!
<i>
Sans adieu!
</i>
[<i>Fastening her wrap.</i>] Get your hat and take me downstairs.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Wait a moment! [<i>Chuckling.</i>] Ho, ho! I'm not to be outdone altogether. [<i>Pocketing her gift, he goes to the cabinet on the right and unlocks it. She watches him from the middle of the room.

<p>
What about?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
You've attempted to play us all a rascally trick, Mackworth; a low, scurvy, contemptible&#8212;&#8212;
</p>

Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Frowning.</i>] A trick?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
I've just come from Mr. Dunning&#8212;a man I've thought it my duty to employ in the interests of my family&#8212;Sillitoe and Dunning, the private-inquiry people&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Private-inquiry people?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
Dunning rang me up an hour ago, and I went down to him. The discovery wasn't clinched till this afternoon&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
The discovery?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Derisively.</i>] Ho! This precious book of yours&#8212;&#34;The Big Drum&#34;! A grand success, Mackworth!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Perplexed.</i>] I don't&#8212;&#8212;

<p>
Fraud?

<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
Reached its twenty-fifth thousand, and the demand still continues! You and Mr. what's-his-name&#8212;Titterton&#8212;ought to be publicly exposed, Mackworth; and if we were in the least spiteful and vindictive&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Tightening his lips.</i>] Are you sober, Filson?

</p>
<p>
Now, don't you be insolent, because it won't answer. [<span class="sc">Philip

winces, but restrains himself.</i>] The question is, what are we to do
<i>
to-night</i>&#8212;for Ottoline's sake, I mean t'say. We must spare her as much shock and distress as possible. I assume you've sufficient decency left to agree with me there. My father and mother too&#8212;they're quite ignorant of the steps I've been taking&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Controlling himself with difficulty.</i>] My good fellow, will you condescend to explain&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Walking away.</i>] Oh, it's no use, Mackworth&#8212;this air of innocence! [<i>Puffing himself out and strutting to and fro on the left.</i>] It's simply wasted effort, I mean t'say. In five minutes I can have Dunning here with the whole disreputable story. He's close by&#8212;bottom of Chancery Lane. He'll be at his office till half-past-eleven&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Between his teeth&#8212;thrusting his hands into his trouser-pockets.</i>] Very accommodating of him!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
I tried to get on to my father from Dunning's&#8212;to ask his advice, I mean t'say&#8212;but he'd dressed early and gone to one of his clubs, and they couldn't tell me which one. [<i>Halting and looking at his watch.</i>]
<i>
My
</i>
suggestion is that you and I should struggle through this farce of a dinner as best we can&#8212;as if nothing had happened. I mean t'say&#8212;and that I should reserve the disclosure of your caddish conduct till to-morrow. You assent to that course, Mackworth? [<i>Dabbing his forehead with his handkerchief.</i>] Thank heaven, the announcement of the engagement hasn't appeared!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>In a calm voice.</i>] Bertram&#8212;[<i>pointing to the chair on the left of the smoking-table</i>] Bertie, old man&#8212;[<i>seating himself easily upon the settee on the right</i>] you're your sister's brother and I'm not going to lose my temper&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Sneeringly.</i>] My dear sir&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Leaning back and crossing his legs.</i>] One thing I seem to grasp clearly; and that is that, while I've been endeavouring to conciliate you, and make a pal of you, you've been leaguing yourself with a tame detective with the idea of injuring me in some way with Ottoline and your father and mother. [<i>Folding his arms.</i>] That's correct, isn't it?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
[<i>With a disdainful shrug.</i>] If you think it will benefit you to distort my motives, Mackworth, pray do so. [<i>Returning to the middle of the room.</i>] What I've done, I've done, as I've already stated, from a sheer sense of duty&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Again pointing to the chair.</i>] Please! You'll look less formidable, old man&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Sitting, haughtily.</i>] Knowing what depended on the fate of your book, I felt from the first that you might be unscrupulous enough to induce your publisher to represent it as being a popular success&#8212;in order to impose on us, I mean t'say&#8212;though actually it was another of your failures to hit the mark; and when Titterton started blowing the trumpet so loudly, my suspicions increased. [<span class="sc">Philip
</span>
<i>
slowly unfolds his arms.</i>] As for desiring to injure you with my family at any price, I scorn the charge. I've had the delicacy to refrain from even mentioning my suspicions to my father and mother, let alone Ottoline. [<i>Putting his necktie straight and smoothing his hair and his slightly crumpled shirt-front.</i>] Deeply as I regret your connection with my sister, I should have been only too happy, I mean t'say, if my poor opinion of you had been falsified.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>His hands clenched, but preserving his suavity.</i>] Extremely grateful to you, Bertie. I see! And so, burdened by these suspicions, you carried them to Mr.&#8212;Mr. Gunning?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
Dunning. I didn't regard it as a job for a respectable solicitor&#8212;&#8212;

<p>
[<i>Uncrossing his legs and sitting upright.</i>] Well, that brings us to the point, doesn't it?
</p>
<p class="actor">

The point?

<p class="actor">
Bertram.
</p>
<p>
[<i>In a pitying tone.</i>] Oh, my dear Mackworth! I repeat, it's no

your adopting this attitude. You don't realize how completely you're bowled over, I mean t'say. Dunning's got incontestable proofs&#8212;&#8212;
</p>

Mackworth&#8212;&#34;The Big Drum&#34;&#8212;published September the second, and drew our attention to the advertisements of Mr. Mackworth's publisher&#8212;Mr. Clifford Titterton, of Charles Street, Adelphi&#8212;relating to the same. Mr. F. having made us acquainted with the special circumstances of the case, and furnished us with his reasons for doubting Titterton's flowery statements, [<i>wetting his thumb again and turning to the next leaf of his note-book</i>] on the following day, the twenty-fifth, I purchased a copy of the said book at Messrs. Blake and Hodgson's in the Strand, Mr. Hodgson himself informing me in the course of conversation that, as far as his firm was concerned, the book wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. [<i>Repeating the thumb process.</i>] I then proceeded to pump one of the gals&#8212;er&#8212;to interrogate one of the assistants&#8212;at a circulating library Mrs. D. subscribes to, with a similar result.

What happened was this. I overtook 'em at the bottom of the stairs, and begged 'em to let me go back with them to Ennismore Gardens. Lady Filson and I got into one cab, Sir Randle and Madame de Chaumi&#233; into another. Bertram Filson slunk off to his club. At Ennismore Gardens we had the most depressin' meal I've ever sat down to, and then Madame Ottoline proposed that I should smoke a cigarette in her boudoir. [<i>Distressed.</i>] Oh, my dear Phil&#8212;&#8212;!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
W-w-what&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
I can't bear to see a woman in tears; I can't, positively.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Between his teeth.</i>] Confound you, Robbie, who can! Don't brag about it.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
At first she swept up and down the room like an outraged Empress. Her skirts created quite a wind. I won't attempt to tell you all the bitter things she said&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Of me?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
And of
<i>
me</i>, dear excellent friend.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Grimly.</i>] For your share in the business.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>With a nod.</i>] The fatal luncheon in South Audley Street. However, she soon softened, and came and knelt by the fire. And suddenly&#8212;you've seen a child fall on the pavement and cut its knees, haven't you, Phil?&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Of course I have.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
That's how she cried. I was really alarmed.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
The&#8212;the end of it being&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Dismally.</i>] The end of it being that she went off to bed, declaring that she recognizes that the breach between you is beyond healing, and that she's resolved never to cross your path again if she can avoid it.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Laying his pipe aside.</i>] Ha! [<i>Scowling at

Roope</span>.] And so this is the result of your self-appointed mission, is it?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>

[<i>Hurt.</i>] That's rather ungrateful, Phil&#8212;&#8212;
</p>

</p>
<p>
[<i>Starting up and walking away to the left.</i>] P'sha!
</p>

</p>
<p class="actor">

</p>
<p>
[<i>Striding up and down.</i>] What had I better do? It's good of you to be here so early. [<span class="sc">Roope

<i>
not
</i>
ungrateful, Robbie. Advise me.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Stiffly.</i>] I assume, from your tone, that what you
<i>
wish
</i>
to do is to&#8212;er&#8212;&#8212;?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
To abase myself before her; to grovel at her feet and crave her pardon for my behaviour of last night. What else should I want to do, in God's name!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Dryly.</i>] I see, you've slept on it.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Laid awake on it. [<i>Fiercely.</i>] Do I look as if I'd slept the sleep of a healthy infant?
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
I don't know anything about infants, I am happy to say, healthy or ailing; but certainly your treatment of Madame de Chaumi&#233; was atrocious.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
Brutal, savage, inhuman! [<i>Halting and extending his arms.</i>] And what's been her fault? She's dared to love me eagerly, impetuously, uncontrollably&#8212;<i>me</i>, a conceited, egotistical fellow who is no more worth her devotion than the pompous beast who opens her father's front-door! And because, out of her love, she commits a heedless, impulsive act which deals a blow at my rotten pride, I slap her face and turn my back upon her, and suffer her to leave my rooms as though she's a charwoman detected in prigging silver from my cash-box! [<i>Clasping his brow and groaning.</i>] Oh&#8212;! [<i>In sudden fury at seeing
</i>
<span class="sc">
Roope
</span>

</p>
<p>
[<i>Holding out his hand penitently.</i>] Shut up!

<p>
[<i>Presenting

<i>
She
</i>
has slept&#8212;or laid awake&#8212;on the events of last night too, recollect.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Raising his head.</i>] Having been kicked out of this place a few hours ago, her affection for me revives with the rattle of the milk-cans!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Evasively.</i>] At any rate, she must be conscious that you were smarting under provocation. She confessed as much during our talk. [<i>Magnanimously.</i>] Even
<i>
I
</i>
admit you had provocation.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
<i>
That
</i>
never influenced a woman, Robbie. Besides, I've insulted this one before&#8212;grossly insulted her, in the old days in Paris&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
Ancient history!
<i>
My
</i>
advice is&#8212;since you invite it&#8212;my advice is that you write her a letter&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Philip.
</p>
<p>
I've composed half-a-dozen already. [<i>Pointing to a waste-paper basket by the writing-table.</i>] The pieces are in that basket.
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
No, no; not a highly-wrought performance. Simply a line, asking her to receive you. [<span class="sc">Philip
</span>

rises listlessly.</i>] Send it along by messenger. [<i>With growing enthusiasm.</i>] Look here! I'll take it!
</p>
<p class="actor">

[<i>Gloomily, his hand on Roope's shoulder.</i>] Ho, ho! You&#8212;you indefatigable old Cupid!
</p>
<p class="actor">
Roope.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Looking at his watch.</i>] Quarter-past-ten. [<i>Excitedly.</i>] Phil, I bet you a hundred guineas&#8212;[<i>correcting himself</i>] er&#8212;well&#8212;five pounds&#8212;I bet you five pounds I'm with you again, with a favourable reply, before twelve!

<p>
[<i>Nodding.</i>] She would; she would. [<i>Straightening himself.</i>] Well, Mr. Mackworth, while I was abroad I heard from various sources that you had become a pretty regular visitor at the house of her parents, and that you and she were to be seen together occasionally in the secluded spots of Kensington Gardens; and I naturally inferred that it was yourself she'd had the good taste to single out from among her numerous suitors.

[<i>Taking a cigarette from the box on the table.</i>] Mr. Mackworth, if Filson's prognostications as to the result of the quarrel between you and his sister are fulfilled, it's my intention, after a decent interval, to renew my appeal to her to marry me. [<i>Striking a match.</i>] Is that clear?

<p>
[<i>Lighting his cigarette.</i>] At a loss, are you! [<i>Warmly.</i>] You're at a loss to understand that I'm not the sort of man who'd steal a march upon another where a woman's concerned, and take advantage of his misfortunes in a dirty manner! [<i>Coming to

How merciful this is of you! I've just sent you a letter by Robbie Roope, begging you to see me; you've missed him.

We catch the colour of our surroundings. But what we were, we continue to be&#8212;in the grain.

Ottoline.

[<i>Intensely.</i>] I should

you, under the rose&#8212;quietly pull the strings&#8212;use all the influence I could rake up&#8212;&#8212;

<p>
No, no&#8212;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="actor">
Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
I should. It's in my blood. I couldn't resist it. Whether you wrote as Jones, or Smith, or Robinson, you'd find Jones, Smith, or Robinson artfully puffed and paragraphed and thrust under people's noses in the papers. I'm an incurably vulgar woman, I tell you! [<i>Snatching at her coat&#8212;harshly.</i>]

Ah, que je me connais; que je me connais!

[<i>She holds out her coat to him and he helps her into it. Suddenly, while her back is turned to him, he utters a guttural cry and grips her shoulders savagely. She turns in surprise, her hand to her shoulder.</i>] Oh, Phil&#8212;&#8212;!

Philip.

Mon pauvre Philippe</i>, it's you, not I, who will take another view of things to-morrow. [<i>He makes a gesture of dissent.</i>] Ah, come, come, come! You have never loved me as I have loved you. Unconsciously&#8212;without perceiving it&#8212;one may be half a
<i>
poseuse</i>; but at least I've been sincere in my love for you, and in hungering to be your wife. [<i>Giving him her right hand.</i>] You're the best I've ever known, dear; by far the best I've ever known. [<i>He presses her hand to his brow convulsively.</i>] But when we had our talk in South Audley Street, how did you serve me? You insisted on my waiting&#8212;waiting; I who had cherished your image in my mind for years! You guessed I shouldn't have patience&#8212;you almost prophesied as much; but still&#8212;I was to wait!

<p>
[<i>Inarticulately.</i>] Oh, Otto!
</p>

Ottoline.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Withdrawing her hand.</i>] What did that show, Phil? It showed&#8212;as your compromise with mother and Dad showed afterwards&#8212;that the success of the book you were engaged upon came first with you; that marrying me was to be only an incident in your career; that you didn't love me sufficiently to bend your pride or vary your programme a jot. [<i>He gets to his feet, startled, dumbfoundered. He attempts to speak, but she checks him.</i>] H'sh! H'sh! I'm scolding you; but, for your sake, I wouldn't have it otherwise. Now that I'm sane and cool, I wouldn't have it otherwise.

[<i>Taking his hands in hers.</i>] Good-bye. Don't come downstairs with me. Let me leave you sitting at your table, at work&#8212;at work on that incomplete chapter. We shall tumble up against one another, I dare say, at odd times, but this is the last we shall see of each other
<i>
dans l'intimit&#233;</i>; and I want to print on my memory the sight of you&#8212;[<i>pointing to the writing-table</i>] there&#8212;keeping your flag flying. [<i>Putting her arms round him&#8212;in a whisper.</i>] Keep your flag flying, Philip! Don't&#8212;don't sulk with your art, and be false to yourself, because a trumpery woman has fretted and disturbed you. Keep your flag flying&#8212;[<i>kissing him</i>] my&#8212;my dear hero!

Ottoline

opens the vestibule door, gives

a last look over her shoulder, and enters the vestibule, closing the door behind her. There is a pause, during which

Philip

[<i>With his hand on the door-handle, he wavers, his eyes shifting wildly to and from the writing-table. Then, with a mighty effort, he pulls himself together, strides to the smoking-table, and loads and lights his pipe. Puffing at his pipe fiercely, he reseats himself before his manuscript and, grabbing his pen, forces himself to write. He has written a word or two when he falters&#8212;stops&#8212;and lays his head upon his arm on the table.
